      <description>Classification of Latex symbols using Convolution Neural Networks Dataset - The HASY dataset is derived from HWRT dataset and consists of handwritten symbols. The dataset consists of 168233 instances of black and white images of handwritten symbols. Each image is of size 32x32 labeled with labels. There are 369 labels in total. The dataset can be downloaded from HASY.This repository makes use of supervised learning to classify latex symbols from HASY dataset</description>

      <description>About Deep neural networks have demonstrated a near-human performance in the areas of object detection and face recognition. However, these networks have never been used to create images which look and feel like artistic images. This research introduced by Leon A.Gatys et.al is a novel articial system based on a deep neural network that creates artistic images using neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images.</description>

      <description>Problem Perform the handwritten digit recognition task.This task involves classifying the MNIST digits into their respective classes(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 labelled images of handwritten digits and the task is to come up with a function that can classfify these digits into their respective classes.

      <description>I am currently pusrsuing my Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science with focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Portland State University. I have previously worked as a Software Engineer and built backend and frontend web software. At present I am learning about current trends in Deep Learning with Computer Vision to solve complex problems. I believe in constant growth through learning, contribution, and collaboration with problem solvers.
In my free time, I like to travel, listening to uplifting EDM tunes, watching adrenaline rushing sports and reading books on Psychology.</description>
